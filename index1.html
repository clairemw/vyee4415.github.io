    <p class="hi">--------------------------------------<br>Mechatronics and Robotics Major<br>--------------------------------------</p>
    <div class="box"><h2 class="subs">Arduino</h2></div>
    <p class="p">. . .<br>In my Junior year in Brooklyn Technical High School,<br> I had a chance of choosing through 17 different majors.<br>I chose to focus on the robotics field because I had an interest in mechanical engineering. <br>I worked with Arduino and made lights blink on and off. <br>I had multiple projects to do and worked colaborativelybr
       with different people.<br>. . .</p>

    <div class="box"><h2 class="subs">Scratch</h2></div>
    <p class="p">. . .<br>I made a two player paddleball game with scratch as my first project<br>
      I had some trouble making the paddles move slowly but I eventually got it to work.<br> I've attached the game below and named it Space War. <br> Enjoy playing!<br>. . .</p>

    <div class="box"><h2 class="subs">Python</h2></div>
    <p class="p">. . .<br>In python, I made a text based game that follows a story of <br>a person going through his/her everyday life<br> Every decision that the player makes decides his/her fate.<br>I worked with making a tree diagram and planning all the if statements I would make.<br>. . .</p>

    <div class="box"><h2 class="subs">Python filter</h2></div>
    <p class="p">. . .<br>In python, we learned how to collect every pixel<br>and change the rgb values based on how much red, green, or blue they have.<br>For example, if they have a certain value for their red, it would turn dark blue.<br>This is an example of what I did. Enjoy this cute cat!<br>. . .</p>

    <div class="box"><h2 class="subs">Arduino</h2></div>
    <p class="p">. . .<br>In Arduino, we learned first how to make crcuits. <br>Using C programming, we made the lights flick on and off. <br>We also installed a piezo which makes noises and sounds based on how we coded it. <br>Later in that week, we modified the sirvos and made the robot move. <br>Soon I created a project where the robot could move and the lights could blink<br>
    according to the music the piezo was playing.<br>. . .</p>
